<p>I'm originally from Firth Idaho and spent the majority of my youth working on farms and on outings for hunting and fishing with my father and brothers. I remember noticing in high school how the need for seasonal work for irrigation pipe movers slowly was disappearing due to the rise of automated watering systems, colloquially refered to as 'pivots'. It was concerning to me as an adolescent that an entire class of workers could be made irrelevant so easily, especially since pipe moving was my summer job.

One of the reasons I chose to study computer science and mathematics at BYU-I is that automation is something that allows us to focus on bigger problems. Could I have led a good life and provided a living for a family by moving pipe the rest of my life? Certainly so, and I feel the same about really any industry: medicine, construction, finance, etc.

It is my belief that we should all strive to take on the highest degree of responsibility of which we are able, which makes our short, chaotic lives as meaningful as they can be. Almost all the pipe moving jobs are gone, but maybe the silver lining is that now we can focus on more pressing matters, like the impending heat death of the universe.
