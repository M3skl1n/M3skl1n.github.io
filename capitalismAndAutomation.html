<h2>Capitalism and Automation</h2>
<p>
04/29/2020
<br><br>
I'm originally from Firth Idaho and spent the majority of my youth working on farms and on outings for hunting and fishing with my father and brothers. I remember noticing in high school how the need for seasonal work for irrigation pipe movers slowly was disappearing due to the rise of automated watering systems, colloquially refered to as 'pivots'. It was concerning to me as an adolescent that an entire class of workers could be made irrelevant so easily, especially since pipe moving was my summer job.
    <br><br>
    One of the reasons I chose to study computer science and mathematics at BYU-I is that automation is something that allows us to focus on bigger problems. Could I have led a good life and provided a living for a family by moving pipe the rest of my life (notwithstanding its impending demise)? Certainly so, and I feel the same about really any industry: medicine, construction, finance, etc.
    <br><br>
    It is my belief that we should all strive to take on the highest degree of responsibility of which we are able, which makes our short, chaotic lives as meaningful as they can be. Almost all the pipe moving jobs are gone, but maybe the silver lining is that now we can focus on more pressing matters, like the impending heat death of the universe.
    <br><br>
    Not that any of this is of any concern to the average American. I recently watched the biographical drama "Vice" (which I highly recommend) that depicts the early life and career of vice president Dick Cheney, a believer in the unitray executive theory and the culprit of a major loss of constitutional rights in the U.S. At the end of the film, two people in a political focus group break the fourth wall and get into a physical altercation over their beliefs of the agenda of the film they are in. While they tusle an onlooker comments, "I can't wait for the next 'Fast and Furious' movie to come out." While this may be construed as a slight towards Universal Studios, the reality highlighted by this scene is that most Americans are either too dogmatic or totally apathetic. Rather than spend time comparing information and creating an educated opinion, most Americans are more concerned with being entertained. So they either only engage with a news source that gives a narrative they are naturally inclined to, repeatedly asserting the talking heads' views on social media echo chambers. Or, Americans simply do not engage at all.
    <br><br>
    The U.S. is ripe for culture death as we continue to engage in 'breads and circuses': As I sit here and type, the government is issuing billions of dollars in aid for a quaratined citizenry during the coronavirus outbreak. The massive entertainment industry (America's top export) keeps us so distracted that we couldn't care less about what the government is doing or what we think about it. We should, as Neil Postman suggests in "Amusing Ourselves to Death" make our new national capital Las Vegas, NV. The symbol of our nation will be a chorus girl, rather than a hog butcher in Chicago representing former industrial might and entreprenerial risk; or a Minute Man in Boston representing the fight for Liberty.
    <br><br>
    "Brave New World," is on the verge of arriving, the hellish Huxleyian distopia where the state controls the economy. Andrew Yang ran on a platform of universal basic income, amphetamine use for ADHD (distraction disease) and opiod addiction are rampant, and the patriot Edward Snowden lives exhiled in Russia after whistleblowing the NSA's breaking of surveilance law. The only solutions are: sovereign citizens need to push back at the growth of government 'aid' and take care of themselves, their family, and the country as much as they can in that order; Americans need to become as educated as they can about their rights, when they are encroached upon, and the movement of government; Americans need to practice mindfulness and not use entertainment in a compulsive, Pavlovian manner.
    <br><br>
    Cal Newport's method of deep work has never been more important. Our economy in the next few years will increase more and more those that are good 'mind workers', a skill that the distracted masses cannot do, driving them into the arms of government tyranny, preferring to be a fed slave rather than starve in freedom. I'm not an opponent of some welfare system, I don't think there is any utility in people starving to death. But the poor of America are actually overfed with the majority being obese.
    <br><br>
    To fix this, I propose that a citizen debate club ought to be performed in which everyone prepares once a month for a debate on a controversial subject, rather than just ranting about it on a sub-Reddit where everyone agrees with them. Each citizen would take the position that they disagree with and play the devil's advocate. The practice of vipassna or mindfulness meditation needs to become more widespread.
